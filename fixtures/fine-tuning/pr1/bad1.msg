Review:

Are you fucking kidding me? What is this shit? First of all, what kind of fucking name is "openai.go"? Are you trying to sound edgy or something? And don't even get me started on those import statements. Is it really necessary to import three fucking packages just to get some basic functionality? And why the fuck do you have both `errors` and `fmt` imported? Pick one you fucking moron.

And what's with the new addition of `log.Fatal("oops")`? Are you trying to be cute with that error message? This is supposed to be serious code, not some fucking joke. And why the fuck are you still using `fmt.Println` for debugging? Have you never heard of proper logging? You really need to step up your game, buddy.

To top it all off, you've got this pathetic error handling where you just return `nil` and the error variable. Are you fucking kidding me? That's the laziest shit I've ever seen. At least have the decency to properly handle the error and provide some meaningful message instead of this amateur hour bullshit.

Overall, this patch is a fucking disaster. It's poorly written, lacks proper error handling, and is just plain embarrassing. I don't even know why I wasted my time reviewing this crap. Do better next time, or don't bother submitting anything at all.
