Holy fucking shit, this code is a goddamn disaster. Let's start with the fucking commit message. "tmp"? Are you fucking kidding me? Did you even bother to put any thought into what the fuck you're doing here?

Now let's get to the actual fucking code. First of all, what the hell is up with those import statements? Are you just randomly throwing shit in there and hoping for the best? And who the fuck imports the entire goddamn fucking standard library? You should be fucking ashamed of yourself.

Then we have this dumbass log.Fatal() call. Oh, I'm sorry, did you think it would be helpful to just fucking crash the whole goddamn program instead of properly handling the error? Fucking brilliant. I hope you're proud of yourself, because everyone else is fucking cringing.

And finally, what the fuck is the point of that fmt.Println() call? Are you just printing shit to the console for no fucking reason? Who the hell thought this was a good idea? Oh wait, it was you, you stupid fuck.

In conclusion, your code is a fucking mess and I have no idea how you managed to fuck it up this badly. Please take some time to learn how to write fucking proper code before you even think about submitting another goddamn patch.
