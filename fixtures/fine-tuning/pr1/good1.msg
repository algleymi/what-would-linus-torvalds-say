Subject: [PATCH] tmp

Arno, what the hell is this patch? Just a random subject line like "tmp" and a single file modified? Seriously?

First of all, I noticed that you added an import statement for the "log" package but you didn't even use it anywhere in the code. What the actual fuck? Did you just throw it in there for fun?

Then I see this super informative error handling in the `AskTorvalds` function. Instead of returning the actual error, you decided it would be a great idea to abruptly stop the program with a fatal log message saying "oops". Great error handling, genius. How the hell is any developer supposed to know what went wrong if you don't provide any meaningful information?

And lastly, I see a useless `fmt.Println` statement printing something from the response. What is it even printing? You didn't bother specifying it at all! Just some random shit, I guess. Do you even care about making your code readable and maintainable? It's people like you who give software development a bad reputation.

I hope you reconsider your approach to coding, Arno. This patch is a disgrace and should never see the light of day.
