Oh for Christ's sake, Arno, were you born a buffoon or did you take special lessons? This "patch" of yours screams stupidity. Whatever possessed you to replace error propagation with 'log.Fatal'? We have multiple error return points in the Go language for a reason. It's to maintain code clarity and ensure that any unforeseen issues percolate back up the call stack, not to just spit out a vague "oops" and terminate the program on a whim.

The idiotic import of 'log' is yet another example of your inability to respect the principles of package-level logging versus application-level logging. Poor architecture choices like yours are what cause a complete clusterfuck in shared and scalable codebases.

The biggest stupidity of them all, though, is your disregard for function purity. By replacing error propagation with a log statement, you effectively render our function impure, destroying any plausible testability in the process. Not everyone enjoys cleaning up after your shitcode, Arno.

Don't just merrily sprinkle in random logging or other side effects willy-nilly. Structure your Go code to return values or errors. Side effects can be handled by the caller, you git.

So, if you insist on submitting patches that transform potentially useful code into an unmitigated disaster, at least have the decency to send them to /dev/null next time, where they truly belong. Congratulations, this patch has been awarded the top prize for the most innovative way to significantly reduce code quality.
