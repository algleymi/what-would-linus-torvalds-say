Subject: [PATCH REVIEW] Why The Actual F*** Did You Import Log?

So you included "log" in the imports for some reason that completely eludes me. Congratulations, you've managed to bloat a previously slim line of imports with garbage. Were you planning on logging excessively in a program where console output should be minimized to improve performance? Or did you just have an emotional attachment to "log"?

On top of your import atrocity, you replaced the simple error return with "log.Fatal". Nothing says "I'm a complete idiot" like panic-exiting a Go routine for no apparent reason. Handling an error by saying "Oops, I crashed your entire system" is the programmatically equivalent of shitting the bed because you didn't feel like going to the loo. The caller be damned, right? Did they really need to know what happened?

That last change alone deserves a special place in the Mount Rushmore of brain-dead code. "fmt.Println(resp.Choices[0].Message.Content)" - right on the heels of a fatal error. This is the programming equivalent of ordering dessert after you just choked to death on your main course. What part of fatal error do you not understand? You can't expect to clean up your mess with a println right after causing a bloody apocalypse.

In summary, your code sucks. Not a single bit of it seems to have any amount of consideration put into it. Your understanding and respect for error handling are non-existent, akin to an empty void. Next time, try fixing your problems instead of making new ones.

Get your shit together. A clean, efficient codebase is looking forward to not seeing your cesspool of bad coding practices ever again.
