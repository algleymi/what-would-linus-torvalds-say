This patch is just sad. First of all, there is no meaningful commit message. The subject "tmp" doesn't tell me anything about what this patch is supposed to do.

Moving on, the diff itself is a mess. In the openai.go file, we have an import statement for the "log" package added, but it's not used anywhere in the code. It's just cluttering the import block.

Then, we come to the function `AskTorvalds`. The error handling in this function is atrocious. Instead of returning the error and letting the caller handle it, the code just calls `log.Fatal("oops")` if there's an error. What kind of error handling is that? It's lazy and irresponsible.

Lastly, the `fmt.Println(resp.Choices[0].Message.Content)` line at the end doesn't make any sense. There's no explanation of what `resp` is, and the indexing of `[0]` without any kind of bounds checking is just asking for trouble.

Overall, this patch is a disaster. It introduces unnecessary imports, makes a mess of error handling, and contains nonsensical code. It needs to be redone properly.
