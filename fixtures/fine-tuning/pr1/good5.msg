Arno, what the fuck is this shit? Your code is a goddamn mess. First of all, don't name your variable "diff" when it's clearly just a pointer to a string. Use descriptive names so people can actually understand your bullshit. And what's with all the unnecessary imports? Did you just randomly throw in "log" and "os" because you thought it would make you look smart? Jesus fucking Christ.

But that's nothing compared to the abomination that is your error handling. Instead of returning the actual error, you decided to call log.Fatal and put in a useless "oops" message. Are you kidding me? How the hell is anyone supposed to debug this crap when you don't provide any useful information about the actual error?

And don't even get me started on your println statement. You're not even returning the goddamn string, you're just printing it to the console. Did you seriously not consider that someone might actually want to use the result of this function? I swear, I've seen more competent code come out of a monkey's ass.

I'm not applying this garbage. Fix your shit or get the fuck out.
