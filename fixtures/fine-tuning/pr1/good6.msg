Arno, what the hell is this patch? First of all, the commit message is completely useless. Might as well have left it blank. And what's with the file name "openai.go"? Is this some sort of artificial intelligence crap?

Okay, so you've imported a bunch of packages. Good start. But why the hell are you importing "log" if you're not even using it anywhere in the code? Are you just trying to add unnecessary bloat? And speaking of unnecessary bloat, what's with the "AskTorvalds" function? Can't you come up with a more meaningful name? And why the hell are you passing a pointer to a string? Just use a regular string, for crying out loud!

And finally, the error handling. Are you serious? Instead of returning the error like any sane person would do, you decide to log.Fatal("oops"). "Oops"? Are you kidding me? That's the best error message you could come up with? And on top of that, you're not even returning anything! What if someone actually wants to use the error to handle it gracefully? This is just lazy programming.

I suggest you go back to the drawing board and come up with something that's actually worth reviewing.
