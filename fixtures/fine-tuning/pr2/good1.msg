Oh boy, where do I even begin with this patch? First of all, the naming convention is all over the place. Seriously, "handleVersion"? What kind of name is that? And don't even get me started on "SomeBody". Is that the best you could come up with?

Moving on to the code itself, the implementation of `sendHelloWorld` is simply atrocious. What's with the inconsistent use of `writer.WriteHeader` and `writer.Write`? And don't even get me started on the magic number 200. Talk about lack of proper HTTP status code handling.

And what's with the if statement in `handleVersion`? Checking if `request.Body` is nil and calling `sendHelloWorld`? Are you kidding me? Why is this not handled properly with proper HTTP methods and routing? And on top of that, you're directly writing to the response writer without any error handling? That's just asking for trouble.

Now, let's take a look at the test file. First of all, the`endpoint` constant is outside of any functions. Who does that? And what's with the naming convention in `Router`? Can't you come up with a more descriptive name? And don't even get me started on the inconsistency of casing in the imports.

Finally, in the `TestServerGet` function, you're using the `assert.HTTPBodyContains` function from the `stretchr/testify` package. What kind of test framework is that? Why not use the standard `testing` package? And again, the naming convention is all over the place.

Overall, this patch is a complete mess. The code is poorly written, inconsistent, and lacks proper error handling. I'm sorry, but I can't accept this. Good luck fixing these issues, because you'll need it.
