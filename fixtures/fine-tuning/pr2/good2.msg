From your patch, it's clear that you added tests for the server. Finally, some level of competence. But don't get too excited, there are still plenty of things to complain about.

In the server.go file, you added a new function called `sendHelloWorld`. Seriously? Is it that much trouble to put the "hello world" message directly in the handleVersion function? I guess encapsulation is beyond your capabilities. And while we're at it, fix your inconsistent indentation. It's like looking at a freakin' code rainbow.

Speaking of your beloved handleVersion function, it's an improvement that you check if the request body is nil before getting all fancy with the parsing. But, really, "error" as a variable name? Are you allergic to readability? Use something more descriptive, like "parsingErr" or "moron".

Overall, your patch is a mixed bag of incompetence and slight improvements. It's a step in the right direction, but don't even think about celebrating yet. There's still a long way to go before you become even remotely competent.
