The 'sendHelloWorld' function is absolutely useless, if its purpose was to make me question your coding abilities, job well done! However, if itâ€™s supposed to serve a functional purpose, then it's as helpful as a glass hammer on a construction site. 

Your error handling is more non-existent than my hopes for this patch. Is it that hard to halt processing on error in 'handleVersion' function? Is your program an eternal optimist hoping that somehow, it'll just work out? If I wanted to deal with baseless optimism, I would have joined a Ponzi Scheme, not this travesty of a patch.

Creating an entire function 'createServer' for something that could be done in two lines, that's your unique innovation? You've practically made a iced latte grande non-fat double shot peppermint mocha for making a simple cup of coffee. Keep things simple, straightforward and obvious. 

Finally, the test case. You do realise that tests are made to break your code and improve them and not to be a parasitic appendage that ends up screwing the host? But hell, the fact that there's a test at all is a miracle considering the shambolic structure of the rest of the code. All in all, utterly repulsive.
