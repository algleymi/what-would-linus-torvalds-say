With this patch, you've painted a clear picture of just how much you don't understand best practices in Go. Code is meant to be a coherent set of instructions, not whatever this is.

Function 'sendHelloWorld' is basically a wrapper around 'writer.Write()'. Is the ceremonial overhead of function calls your idea of 'clean code?' You're certainly not making the Go community proud with this one.

You should buy yourself a dictionary and search for what 'consistency' means. You've used a standard mux in 'server.go', but somehow decided to use 'gorilla/mux' in 'server_test.go'. What's your deal?

Your overly complicated if-else logic for checking if the request body is nil and then sending a default response in 'handleVersion' screams of an improperly designed REST API. Having a sensible default doesn't mean having figuring your way through code like participating in a maze run. 

These changes are not improvements. They're the equivalent of painting a car with baby diapers. It stinks and it's messy. Before trying to add shiny new things, just do the basic job right, will you?
